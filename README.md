## Reproducing the reported toy examples
Toy examples presented in the paper are based on `elicito (v0.5.5)`.
For further information on our `elicito` Package see the corresponding
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/florence-bockting/elicito).

**Simulation scripts** for both toy examples are available
in the `toy-examples` folder.

The resulting **simulation plots** are saved in the `saved_plots` folder. 

Additionally, the corresponding Jupyter notebook for each simulation script is
provided in the `notebooks` folder. 
These notebooks can be executed directly online via Binder using the links below:
